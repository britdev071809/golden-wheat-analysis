# Supply Management Program for Golden Wheat Market

## Problem Statement

The Golden Wheat market has experienced persistent oversupply over the last decade, driven by technological improvements, favorable weather patterns, and expanded acreage. This oversupply has led to chronically low market prices, often below the cost of production for small‑scale farmers. The result is a steady decline in farm profitability, increasing debt loads, and the exit of family‑scale operations from the industry. Without intervention, the long‑term viability of the wheat‑producing sector is at risk.

## Proposed Solution

*[Placeholder for data‑driven program design: e.g., a voluntary set‑aside program triggered by specific oversupply indicators.]*

## Impact Analysis

*[Placeholder for estimated reduction in production needed to restore prices to sustainable levels, along with projected economic benefits.]*

## Implementation

*[Placeholder for step‑by‑step rollout, administrative structure, and monitoring mechanisms.]*
